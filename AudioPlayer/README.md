# Upplýsingar um forritið AudioPlayer1

This program plays songs from two playlists. When the program is run, a window with images of these
playlists bursts open. To open the lists, you simply click on them. You can log in by 
clicking "skrá inn". When this is done, a window with login fields appears. 
When the login is completed, the name used for login is displayed above the playlists. 
When entering the playlist, it is possible to stop playing some songs, but one can click
on "Heim" to return to the starting page.
